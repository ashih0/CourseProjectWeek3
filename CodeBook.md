# Code Book

## Introduction

The raw data is based on:

    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The provided `data_summarized.txt` dataset was generated by the
`run_analysis.R` script.  It averages the data over groups formed by
combinations of `Subject` and `Activity`.

The `data_unsummarized.txt` dataset provides the data before
summarization and is simply an arrangement of the original data into a
tidy dataset with more obvious (though longer) variable names.


## Activity Types

The activity types in the study were:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A) for an
example of the how the measurement apparatus was attached to the test
subject.


## Measurement Types

There are two main measurement types as described in `'UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt'`:

* Linear Acceleration

    Variables with `LinearAcceleration` in their name are taken from
    the Samsung Galaxy S II using its embedded accelerometer.  Linear
    acceleration for 3 axes were captured at a rate of 50 Hz and are
    indicated by `X`, `Y`, or `Z` in the variable name.

    This measurement is in standard gravity units "g".  To interpret
    this as physical units, multiply the value of the variable by 9.8
    m / s^2 .  However, most analyses of the data are likely only
    concerned with how the measurements relate to each other instead
    of any physical phenomenon outside the system.

* Angular Velocity

    Variables with `AngularVelocity` in their name are taken from
    Samsung Galaxy S II using its embedded gyroscope.  Angular
    velocity for 3 axes were captured at a rate of 50 Hz.

    These measurements are in units of radians / second.


## Signal Processing

The signal processing applied to the raw data from the accelerometers
and gyroscopes is described in `'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'`.

Raw signal data was filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low
pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove
noise.


## Gravity vs Body

The distinction between "Gravity" and "Body" signals is described in
`'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'`.

Body and Gravity acceleration signals were separated using another low
pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

This is indicated in the variable names containing `Body` and
`Gravity`, respectively in both this, and the original dataset.

## BodyBody

Variables in the original dataset containing `BodyBody` are assumed to
be typos and have been converted to `Body` in this dataset.


## Sliding Windows

The smoothing of data is described on the web page:

    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128
readings/window) were used.

* Mean

   Mean of the measurement in the sliding window indicated by `Mean`
   in the variable name.

    In the original dataset, these values were indicated by including
    `-mean()` in the name.

* Standard Deviation

    Standard deviation of the measurement in the sliding window
    indicated by "StandardDeviation" in the variable name.

    In the original dataset, these values were indicated by including
    `-std()` in the name.


## Processing

Processing applied to the "raw" data is described in `'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'`.

* Magnitude

    "Magnitude" in the name indicates that is a euclidian norm over the
    corresponding `X`, `Y`, and `Z` measurements.

    In the original dataset, these variables were indicated by including
    `Mag` in the name.


* Derivative

    Variables with `Derivative` in the name were derived based in time
    based on the 50 Hz sampling frequency.

    These are available for both `LinearAcceleration` and `AngularVelocity`
    variables.

    In the original dataset, these variables were indicated by including
    `Jerk` in the name.


## Time and Frequency Domain

* TimeDomain

    Variable names beginning with `TimeDomain` are the original
    measurements taken at 50 Hz.

    In the original dataset, these variables were indicated by beginning
    with a lower case `t` in the name.

* FrequencyDomain

    A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the signals.

    Variable names beginning with `FrequencyDomain` are passed through
    from the original data set.

    In the original dataset, these variables were indicated by beginning
    with a lower case `f` in the name.

## Name Mapping

The relationship between the variable names in `data_summarized.txt`
and the origial data in ``'UCI HAR Dataset/'` is as follows:
